abstract = {Recent clinical data support ideas of Programmed death receptor-ligand 1 (PD-L1; also called B7-H1, CD274) playing an important role in immune evasion of tumor cells. Expression of PD-L1 on tumors strongly correlates with the survival of cancer patients. PD-L1 on tumors interacts with the co-inhibitory molecule Programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1, CD279) on T cells mediating decreased TCR-mediated proliferation and cytokine production. In animal tumor models, blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 interactions resulted in an improved tumor control. In addition, exhausted T cells during chronic viral infections could be revived by PD-L1 blockade. Thus, targeting PD-L1/PD-1 interactions might improve the efficacy of adoptive cell therapies (ACT) of chronic infections as well as cancers. Obstacles for a general blockade of PD-L1 might be its role in mediating peripheral tolerance. This review discusses the currently available data concerning the role of PD-L1 in tumor immune evasion and envisions possibilities for implementation into ACT for cancer patients.},

abstract = {Programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, deliver inhibitory signals that regulate the balance between T cell activation, tolerance, and immunopathology. Immune responses to foreign and self-antigens require specific and balanced responses to clear pathogens and tumors and yet maintain tolerance. Induction and maintenance of T cell tolerance requires PD-1, and its ligand PD-L1 on nonhematopoietic cells can limit effector T cell responses and protect tissues from immune-mediated tissue damage. The PD-1:PD-L pathway also has been usurped by microorganisms and tumors to attenuate antimicrobial or tumor immunity and facilitate chronic infection and tumor survival. The identification of B7-1 as an additional binding partner for PD-L1, together with the discovery of an inhibitory bidirectional interaction between PD-L1 and B7-1, reveals new ways the B7:CD28 family regulates T cell activation and tolerance.

abstract = {The acknowledged success of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) allosteric model stems from its efficacy in accounting for the functional behavior of many complex proteins starting with hemoglobin (the paradigmatic case) and extending to channels and receptors. The kinetic aspects of the allosteric model, however, have been often neglected, with the exception of hemoglobin and a few other proteins where conformational relaxations can be triggered by a short and intense laser pulse, and monitored by time-resolved optical spectroscopy. Only recently the application of time-resolved wide-angle X-ray scattering (TR-WAXS), a direct structurally sensitive technique, unveiled the time scale of hemoglobin quaternary structural transition. In order to test the generality of the MWC kinetic model, we carried out a TR-WAXS investigation in parallel on adult human hemoglobin and on a recombinant protein (HbYQ) carrying two mutations at the active site [Leu(B10)Tyr and His(E7)Gln]. HbYQ seemed an ideal test because, although exhibiting allosteric properties, its kinetic and structural properties are different from adult human hemoglobin. The structural dynamics of HbYQ unveiled by TR-WAXS can be quantitatively accounted for by the MWC kinetic model. Interestingly, the main structural change associated with the R-T allosteric transition (i.e., the relative rotation and translation of the dimers) is approximately 10-fold slower in HbYQ, and the drop in the allosteric transition rate with ligand saturation is steeper. Our results extend the general validity of the MWC kinetic model and reveal peculiar thermodynamic properties of HbYQ. A possible structural interpretation of the characteristic kinetic behavior of HbYQ is also discussed.},

abstract = {The crystal structures of the regulated Src and Hck tyrosine kinases show intramolecular interactions between the phosphorylated tail and the SH2 domain as well as between the SH3 domain, the SH2-catalytic domain linker (SH2-CD linker) and the catalytic domain. The relative contribution of these interactions to regulation of activity is poorly understood. Mutational analysis of Src and Lck revealed that interaction of the SH2-CD linker with the SH3 domain is crucial for regulation. Moreover, three sites of interaction of the linker with the catalytic domain, one at the beginning (Trp260) and two at the back of the small lobe, opposite the catalytic cleft (beta2/beta3 loop; alphaC/beta4 loop), impinge on Src activity. Other activating mutations map to the front of the catalytic domain in the loop preceding the alphaC-helix (beta3/alphaC loop). SH2-CD linker mutants are deregulated in mammalian cells but transform fibroblasts weakly, suggesting that the linker may bind cellular components. Interpretation of our results on the basis of the crystal structure of Src favours a model in which the correctly positioned SH2-CD linker exerts an inhibitory function on catalysis of Src family members by facilitating displacement of the alphaC-helix. This study may provide a template for the generation of deregulated versions of other protein kinases.},

abstract = {We report that during cortical development in the mouse embryo, reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK) critically regulates Notch signaling by antagonizing the ectodomain shedding of Notch ligands, which is mediated by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 10 (ADAM10). In the embryonic brain, RECK is specifically expressed in Nestin-positive neural precursor cells (NPCs). Reck-deficient NPCs undergo precocious differentiation that is associated with downregulated Nestin expression, impaired Notch signaling and defective self-renewal. These phenotypes were substantially rescued either by enhancing Notch signaling or by suppressing endogenous ADAM10 activity. Consequently, we found that RECK regulates the ectodomain shedding of Notch ligands by directly inhibiting the proteolytic activity of ADAM10. This mechanism appeared to be essential for Notch ligands to properly induce Notch signaling in neighboring cells. These findings indicate that RECK is a physiological inhibitor of ADAM10, an upstream regulator of Notch signaling and a critical modulator of brain development.},

abstract = {It is well known that allosteric modulators of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors can both diminish and increase the affinity of receptors for their antagonists. We investigated whether the allosteric modulators can also increase the affinity of receptors for their agonists. Twelve agonists and five allosteric modulators were tested in experiments on membranes of CHO cells that had been stably transfected with genes for the M1-M4 receptor subtypes. Allosterically induced changes in the affinities for agonists were computed from changes in the ability of a fixed concentration of each agonist to compete with [3H]N-methylscopolamine for the binding to the receptors in the absence and the presence of varying concentrations of allosteric modulators. The effects of allosteric modulators varied greatly depending on the agonists and the subtypes of receptors. The affinity for acetylcholine was augmented by (-)-eburnamonine on the M2 and M4 receptors and by brucine on the M1 and M3 receptors. Brucine also enhanced the affinities for carbachol, bethanechol, furmethide, methylfurmethide, pilocarpine, 3-(3-pentylthio-1,2,5-thiadiazol-4-yl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1- methylpyridine (pentylthio-TZTP), oxotremorine-M, and McN-A-343 on the M1, M3, and M4 receptors, for pentylthio-TZTP on the M2 receptors, and for arecoline on the M3 receptors. (-)-Eburnamonine enhanced the affinities for carbachol, bethanechol, furmethide, methylfurmethide, pentylthio-TZTP, pilocarpine, oxotremorine and oxotremorine-M on the M2 receptors and for pilocarpine on the M4 receptors. Vincamine, strychnine, and alcuronium displayed fewer positive allosteric interactions with the agonists, but each allosteric modulator displayed positive cooperativity with at least one agonist on at least one muscarinic receptor subtype. The highest degrees of positive cooperativity were observed between (-)-eburnamonine and pilocarpine and (-)-eburnamonine and oxotremorine-M on the M2 receptors (25- and 7-fold increases in affinity, respectively) and between brucine and pentylthio-TZTP on the M2 and brucine and carbachol on the M1 receptors (8-fold increases in affinity). The discovery that it is possible to increase the affinity of muscarinic receptors for their agonists by allosteric modulators offers a new way to subtype-specific pharmacological enhancement of transmission at cholinergic (muscarinic) synapses.},

Equations are derived to indicate the effect of variables such as the strength of binding of the ligand, the geo- metrical arrangement of subunits, the strength of inter- action between subunits, the energy of the conforma- tion change, and the effect of nonidentical subunits. Rapid methods, i.e., equations and nomograms, are developed to fit theoretical curves to experimental data with a minimum of parameters. Applying these pro- cedures to the binding of oxygen by hemoglobin as an illustrative example, it is seen that a number of simple models can represent the published data accurately. In general it appears that unique mechanisms cannot be established from ligand saturation curves by them- selves, but the mathematical analysis of the curves indi- cates possible sources of additional information to make such distinctions possible.},

abstract = {Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) is a negative costimulatory receptor critical for the suppression of T cell activation in vitro and in vivo. Single cell imaging elucidated a molecular mechanism of PD-1-mediated suppression. PD-1 becomes clustered with T cell receptors (TCRs) upon binding to its ligand PD-L1 and is transiently associated with the phosphatase SHP2 (Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2). These negative costimulatory microclusters induce the dephosphorylation of the proximal TCR signaling molecules. This results in the suppression of T cell activation and blockade of the TCR-induced stop signal. In addition to PD-1 clustering, PD-1-TCR colocalization within microclusters is required for efficient PD-1-mediated suppression. This inhibitory mechanism also functions in PD-1(hi) T cells generated in vivo and can be overridden by a neutralizing anti-PD-L1 antibody. Therefore, PD-1 microcluster formation is important for regulation of T cell activation.},

abstract = {The conformation of the cytoplasmic part of the zeta-chain of the T-cell receptor (TCR) in its free form and bound to detergent micelles has been investigated by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. The zeta-chain is considered to be a mediator between the extracellular antigen and the intracellular signal-transduction cascade leading to T-cell activation. Earlier studies suggested a T-cell activation mechanism that involved a TCR-state-dependent lipid incorporation propensity of the zeta-chain accompanied by a helical folding transition. In order to support this proposed mechanism, standard protein NMR assignment and secondary-structure-elucidation techniques have been applied to the free TCR zeta-chain and to the zeta-chain bound to the detergent LMPG, which forms a micelle, in order to obtain the structural characteristics of this folding transition in a residue-resolved manner. We could assign the resonances of the free zeta-chain at 278 K, and this formed the basis for chemical-shift-perturbation studies to identify lipid binding sites. Our NMR results show that the free TCR zeta-chain is indeed intrinsically unstructured. Regions around the ITAM2 and ITAM3 sequences are involved in a highly dynamic binding of the free zeta-chain to a detergent micelle formed by the acidic lipid LMPG.},

abstract = {Formins are large multidomain proteins required for assembly of actin cables that contribute to the polarity and division of animal and fungal cells. Formin homology-1 (FH1) domains bind profilin, and highly conserved FH2 domains nucleate actin filaments. We characterized the effects of two formins, budding yeast Bni1p and fission yeast Cdc12p, on actin assembly. We used evanescent wave fluorescence microscopy to observe assembly of actin filaments (i) nucleated by soluble formin FH1FH2 domains and (ii) associated with formin FH1FH2 domains immobilized on microscope slides. Bni1p(FH1FH2)p and Cdc12p(FH1FH2)p nucleated new actin filaments or captured the barbed ends of preformed actin filaments that grew by insertion of subunits between the immobilized formin and the barbed end of the filament. Both formins remained bound to growing actin filament barbed ends for {\textgreater}1,000 sec. Elongation of a filament between an immobilized formin and a second anchor point buckled filament segments as short as 0.7 microm, demonstrating that polymerization of single actin filaments produces forces of {\textgreater}1 piconewton, close to the theoretical maximum. After buckling, further growth produced long loops that did not supercoil, suggesting that formins do not stair step along the two subunits exposed on the growing barbed end. In agreement, Arp2/3 complex branched filaments did not rotate as they grew from formins attached to the slide surface. Formins are not mechanistically identical because barbed end elongation from Cdc12(FH1FH2)p, but not Bni1(FH1FH2)p, requires profilin. However, profilin increased the rate of Bni1(FH1FH2)p-mediated barbed end elongation from 75{\%} to 100{\%} of full-speed.},

abstract = {Motile and morphogenetic cellular processes are driven by site-directed assembly of actin filaments. Formins, proteins characterized by formin homology domains FH1 and FH2, are initiators of actin assembly. How formins simply bind to filament barbed ends in rapid equilibrium or find free energy to become a processive motor of filament assembly remains enigmatic. Here we demonstrate that the FH1-FH2 domain accelerates hydrolysis of ATP coupled to profilin-actin polymerization and uses the derived free energy for processive polymerization, increasing 15-fold the rate constant for profilin-actin association to barbed ends. Profilin is required for and takes part in the processive function. Single filaments grow at least 10 $\mu$m long from formin bound beads without detaching. Transitory formin-associated processes are generated by poisoning of the processive cycle by barbed-end capping proteins. We successfully reconstitute formin-induced motility in vitro, demonstrating that this mechanism accounts for the puzzlingly rapid formin-induced actin processes observed in vivo.},

In this study, we use time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer and a, to our knowledge, novel data analysis method to directly measure the end-to-end distance distribution of a phosphorylatable peptide derived from the human microtubule associated protein tau. Our results show that phosphorylation at threonine or serine extends the end-to-end distance and increases the effective persistence length of the tested model peptides. Unexpectedly, the extension is independent of salt concentration, suggestive of a nonelectrostatic origin. The phosphorylation extension and stiffening effect provides a peptide-scale physical interpretation for the posttranslational regulation of the highly abundant protein-protein interactions found in disordered proteins, as well as a potential insight into the regulatory mechanism of the tau protein's microtubule binding activity.},

abstract = {Phosphorylated residues occur preferentially in the intrinsically disordered regions of eukaryotic proteins. In the disordered amino-terminal region of human $\alpha$-actinin-4 (ACTN4), Tyr(4) and Tyr(31) are phosphorylated in cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF), and a mutant with phosphorylation-mimicking mutations of both tyrosines exhibits reduced interaction with actin in vitro. Cleavage of ACTN4 by m-calpain, a protease that in motile cells is predominantly activated at the rear, removes the Tyr(4) site. We found that introducing a phosphomimetic mutation at only Tyr(31) was sufficient to inhibit the interaction with actin in vitro. However, molecular dynamics simulations predicted that Tyr(31) is mostly buried and that phosphorylation of Tyr(4) would increase the solvent exposure and thus kinase accessibility of Tyr(31). In fibroblast cells, EGF stimulation increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a mutant form of ACTN4 with a phosphorylation-mimicking residue at Tyr(4), whereas a truncated mutant representing the product of m-calpain cleavage exhibited EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation at a background amount similar to that observed for a double phosphomimetic mutant of Tyr(4) and Tyr(31). We also found that inhibition of the receptor tyrosine kinases of the TAM family, such as AXL, blocked EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ACTN4. Mathematical modeling predicted that the kinetics of phosphorylation at Tyr(31) can be dictated by the kinase affinity for Tyr(4). This study suggests that tandem-site phosphorylation within intrinsically disordered regions provides a mechanism for a site to function as a switch to reveal a nearby function-regulating site.},

Here, we studied the kinetics and mechanics of signaling complex formation in live Jurkat leukemic T cells using signaling proteins fluores-cently tagged with variants of enhanced GFP (EGFP). Within seconds of contacting coverslips coated with stimulatory anti-bodies, T cells developed small, dynamically regulated clusters which were enriched in the TCR, phosphotyrosine, ZAP-70, LAT, Grb2, Gads, and SLP-76, excluded the lipid raft marker enhanced yellow fluorescent protein–GPI, and T were competent to induce calcium elevations. LAT, Grb2, and Gads were transiently associated with the TCR. Although ZAP-70–containing clusters persisted for more than 20 min, photobleaching studies revealed that ZAP-70 continuously dissociated from and returned to these complexes. Strikingly, SLP-76 translocated to a perinuclear structure after clustering with the TCR. Our results emphasize the dynamically changing composition of signaling complexes and indicate that these complexes can form within seconds of TCR engage-ment, in the absence of either lipid raft aggregation or the formation of a central TCR-rich cluster.},

abstract = {Activation of T cells by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) depends on the complex integration of signals that are delivered by multiple antigen receptors. Most receptor-proximal activation events in T cells were identified using multivalent anti-receptor antibodies, eliminating the need to use the more complex APCs. As the physiological membrane-associated ligands on the APC and the activating antibodies probably trigger the same biochemical pathways, it is unknown why the antibodies, even at saturating concentrations, fail to trigger some of the physiological T-cell responses. Here we study, at the level of the single cell, the responses of T cells to native ligands. We used a digital imaging system and analysed the three-dimensional distribution of receptors and intracellular proteins that cluster at the contacts between T cells and APCs during antigen-specific interactions. Surprisingly, instead of showing uniform oligomerization, these proteins clustered into segregated three-dimensional domains within the cell contacts. The antigen-specific formation of these new, spatially segregated supramolecular activation clusters may generate appropriate physiological responses and may explain the high sensitivity of the T cells to antigen.},

abstract = {The CD4 (T4) antigen is a cell-surface glycoprotein that is expressed predominantly on the surface of helper T cells and has been implicated in the regulation of T-cell activation and in the associative recognition of class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex. In addition, the CD4 antigen appears to serve as a receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). An important question has been whether the CD4 receptor is linked to an intracellular mediator that could regulate the activation of the CD4+ subset. In this paper, we provide preliminary evidence that the CD4 receptor is complexed in detergent lysates to a protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) of 55-60 kDa, which is expressed specifically in T cells. The PTK is the human analogue of the murine pp56LSTRA (pp56lck) and has significant homology with c-src, c-yes, and other members of the src family. The identification of the PTK associated with CD4 receptor was made by use of an antiserum to a synthetic peptide that was deduced from the DNA sequence of PTK. Two-dimensional nonequilibrium pH gradient gel electrophoresis/NaDodSO4/PAGE revealed the kinase to focus as a heterogeneous collection of spots in the pH range of 4.0-5.0. Furthermore, in vitro phosphorylation revealed the phosphorylation of two additional polypeptides at 40 and 80 kDa, in addition to the autophosphorylation of the PTK at 55-60 kDa. The potential importance of the association between the CD4 receptor and the PTK of T cells is discussed in relation to T-cell activation and HIV infectivity.},

abstract = {The T cell costimulatory receptor CD28 is required for the full activation of na{\"{i}}ve T cells and for the development and maintenance of Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells. We showed that the cytoplasmic domain of CD28 was bound to the plasma membrane in resting cells and that ligand binding to CD28 resulted in its release. Membrane binding by the CD28 cytoplasmic domain required two clusters of basic amino acid residues, which interacted with the negatively charged inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. These same clusters of basic residues also served as interaction sites for Lck, a Src family kinase critical for CD28 function. This signaling complex was further stabilized by the Lck-mediated phosphorylation of CD28 Tyr(207) and the subsequent binding of the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of Lck to this phosphorylated tyrosine. Mutation of the basic clusters in the CD28 cytoplasmic domain reduced the recruitment to the CD28-Lck complex of protein kinase C$\theta$ (PKC$\theta$), which serves as a key effector kinase in the CD28 signaling pathway. Consequently, mutation of either a basic cluster or Tyr(207) impaired CD28 function in mice as shown by the reduced thymic differentiation of FoxP3(+) Treg cells. On the basis of these results, we propose a previously undescribed model for the initiation of CD28 signaling.},

Symptoms of tularemia in humans are non-specific, thus making the disease difficult to diagnose. If not quickly diagnosed and treated, the disease has a high mortality rate - thus methods for early and specific diagnosis are of critical importance. This immunoaffinity MALDI MS/MS (iMALDI) assay provides unambiguous detection of F. tularensis peptides at attomole levels from peptide solutions, and at low CFU levels from bacteria. The addition of stable-labeled versions of the peptide as internal standards allows absolute quantitation of F. tularensis peptides with a linear dynamic range spanning two orders of magnitude. The ability of mass spectrometry to obtain amino acid sequence data on affinity-captured peptides provides absolute specificity and avoids “false positives” from the non-specific binding. The F. tularensis iMALDI assay has been applied to different samples, such as nasal swabs. This novel quantitative diagnostic F. tularensis iMALDI assay allows the safe, sensitive and specific detection of F. tularensis. The assay can be easily adapted to other target peptides and therefore has broad application potential in clinical diagnosis of other pathogens and diseases.},

abstract = {Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation play a fundamental role in eukaryotic signaling. Some 30{\%} of proteins are phosphorylated at any time, many on multiple sites, raising the question of how the cellular phosphorylation state is regulated. Previous work for one and two phosphorylation sites has revealed mechanisms, such as distributive phosphorylation, for switch-like regulation of maximally phosphorylated phosphoforms. These insights have led to the influential view that more phosphorylation sites leads to steeper switching, as proposed for substrates like cyclin E and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1. An analytical study of the ordered distributive case reveals a more complex story. Multisite phosphorylation creates an efficient threshold: The proportion of maximally phosphorylated substrate is maintained close to 0 when the ratio of kinase to phosphatase activity lies below a suitable threshold, and this threshold increases with increasing numbers of sites, n. However, above the threshold, the response may not always abruptly switch between 0 and 1, as would be the case for an efficient switch, but may increase in a gradual manner, which becomes more hyperbolic with increasing n. Abrupt switching cannot be attributed merely to n being large. We point out that conventional measures of ultrasensitivity must be modified to discriminate between thresholding and switching; we discuss additional factors that influence switching efficiency and suggest new directions for experimental investigation.},

abstract = {Cytoskeleton assembly is instrumental in the regulation of biological functions by physical forces. In a number of key cellular processes, actin filaments elongated by formins such as mDia are subject to mechanical tension, yet how mechanical forces modulate the assembly of actin filaments is an open question. Here, using the viscous drag of a microfluidic flow, we apply calibrated piconewton pulling forces to individual actin filaments that are being elongated at their barbed end by surface-anchored mDia1 proteins. We show that mDia1 is mechanosensitive and that the elongation rate of filaments is increased up to two-fold by the application of a pulling force. We also show that mDia1 is able to track a depolymerizing barbed end in spite of an opposing pulling force, which means that mDia1 can efficiently put actin filaments under mechanical tension. Our findings suggest that formin function in cells is tightly coupled to the mechanical activity of other machineries.},

abstract = {Many mammalian receptors have been found to regulate cell growth by virtue of a protein-tyrosine kinase domain in their cytoplasmic tail. We recently described an association of the CD4 antigen with a T-cell-specific protein-tyrosine kinase (p56lck; formerly termed pp58lck; EC 2.7.1.112). This interaction represents a potential mechanism by which T-cell growth may be regulated and offers a model by which other members of the src family (products of c-src, c-yes, c-fgr, etc.) may interact with mammalian growth factor receptors. As in the case of the CD4 antigen, the CD8 antigen appears to serve as a receptor for nonpolymorphic regions of products of the major histocompatibility complex and has been implicated in the regulation of T-cell growth. In this study, we reveal that the human CD8 antigen is also associated with the T-cell-specific protein-tyrosine kinase (p56lck). The associated p56lck kinase was detected by use of both in vitro and in vivo labeling regimes using an antiserum to the C terminus of p56lck. Two-dimensional nonequilibrium pH-gradient gel electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated the similarity of p56lck to the protein-tyrosine kinase associated with the CD4 antigen. The catalytic activity of p56lck was revealed by the autophosphorylation of the 55- to 60-kDa kinase and the occasional labeling of a 35-kDa protein. Last, we demonstrate directly that members of the CD3 complex, including the gamma, delta, and epsilon chains, as well as a putative zeta subunit, can be phosphorylated at tyrosine residues by the CD4/CD8.p56lck complex.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our first predictor of protein disorder was published just over a decade ago in the Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (Romero P, Obradovic Z, Kissinger C, Villafranca JE, Dunker AK (1997) Identifying disordered regions in proteins from amino acid sequence. Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks, 1: 90-95). By now more than twenty other laboratory groups have joined the efforts to improve the prediction of protein disorder. While the various prediction methodologies used for protein intrinsic disorder resemble those methodologies used for secondary structure prediction, the two types of structures are entirely different. For example, the two structural classes have very different dynamic properties, with the irregular secondary structure class being much less mobile than the disorder class. The prediction of secondary structure has been useful. On the other hand, the prediction of intrinsic disorder has been revolutionary, leading to major modifications of the more than 100 year-old views relating protein structure and function. Experimentalists have been providing evidence over many decades that some proteins lack fixed structure or are disordered (or unfolded) under physiological conditions. In addition, experimentalists are also showing that, for many proteins, their functions depend on the unstructured rather than structured state; such results are in marked contrast to the greater than hundred year old views such as the lock and key hypothesis. Despite extensive data on many important examples, including disease-associated proteins, the importance of disorder for protein function has been largely ignored. Indeed, to our knowledge, current biochemistry books don't present even one acknowledged example of a disorder-dependent function, even though some reports of disorder-dependent functions are more than 50 years old. The results from genome-wide predictions of intrinsic disorder and the results from other bioinformatics studies of intrinsic disorder are demanding attention for these proteins.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Disorder prediction has been important for showing that the relatively few experimentally characterized examples are members of a very large collection of related disordered proteins that are wide-spread over all three domains of life. Many significant biological functions are now known to depend directly on, or are importantly associated with, the unfolded or partially folded state. Here our goal is to review the key discoveries and to weave these discoveries together to support novel approaches for understanding sequence-function relationships.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Intrinsically disordered protein is common across the three domains of life, but especially common among the eukaryotic proteomes. Signaling sequences and sites of posttranslational modifications are frequently, or very likely most often, located within regions of intrinsic disorder. Disorder-to-order transitions are coupled with the adoption of different structures with different partners. Also, the flexibility of intrinsic disorder helps different disordered regions to bind to a common binding site on a common partner. Such capacity for binding diversity plays important roles in both protein-protein interaction networks and likely also in gene regulation networks. Such disorder-based signaling is further modulated in multicellular eukaryotes by alternative splicing, for which such splicing events map to regions of disorder much more often than to regions of structure. Associating alternative splicing with disorder rather than structure alleviates theoretical and experimentally observed problems associated with the folding of different length, isomeric amino acid sequences. The combination of disorder and alternative splicing is proposed to provide a mechanism for easily "trying out" different signaling pathways, thereby providing the mechanism for generating signaling diversity and enabling the evolution of cell differentiation and multicellularity. Finally, several recent small molecules of interest as potential drugs have been shown to act by blocking protein-protein interactions based on intrinsic disorder of one of the partners. Study of these examples has led to a new approach for drug discovery, and bioinformatics analysis of the human proteome suggests that various disease-associated proteins are very rich in such disorder-based drug discovery targets.},

abstract = {Many actin structures are nucleated and assembled by the barbed-end tracking polymerase formin family, including filopodia, focal adhesions, the cytokinetic ring and cell cortex. These structures respond to forces in distinct ways. Formins typically have profilin-actin binding sites embedded in highly flexible disordered FH1 domains, hypothesized to diffusively explore space to rapidly capture actin monomers for delivery to the barbed end. Recent experiments demonstrate that formin-mediated polymerization accelerates when under tension. The acceleration has been attributed to modifying the state of the FH2 domain of formin. Intriguingly, the same acceleration is reported when tension is applied to the FH1 domains, ostensibly pulling monomers away from the barbed end. Here we develop a mesoscale coarse-grain model of formin-mediated actin polymerization, including monomer capture and delivery by FH1, which sterically interacts with actin along its entire length. The binding of actin monomers to their specific sites on FH1 is entropically disfavored by the high disorder. We find that this penalty is attenuated when force is applied to the FH1 domain by revealing the binding site, increasing monomer capture efficiency. Overall polymerization rates can decrease or increase with increasing force, depending on the length of FH1 domain and location of binding site. Our results suggest that the widely varying FH1 lengths and binding site locations found in known formins could be used to differentially respond to force, depending on the actin structure being assembled.

The T cell antigen receptor (TCR) on the surface of T cells is phosphorylated by the kinase Lck and dephosphorylated by the phosphatase CD45 on multiple immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). Intriguingly, Lck sequentially phosphorylates ITAMs and ZAP-70, a cytosolic kinase, binds to phosphorylated ITAMs with differential affinities. The purpose of multiple ITAMs, their sequential phosphorylation, and the differential ZAP-70 affinities are unknown. Here, we use a systems model to show that this signaling architecture produces emergent ultrasensitivity resulting in switch-like responses at the scale of individual TCRs. Importantly, this switch-like response is an emergent property, so that removal of multiple ITAMs, sequential phosphorylation, or differential affinities abolishes the switch. We propose that highly regulated TCR phosphorylation is achieved by an emergent switch-like response and use the systems model to design novel chimeric antigen receptors for therapy.},

Knocking down PAGE4 expression results in cell death, whereas its overexpression leads to a growth advantage of prostate cancer cells (Zeng, Y., He, Y., Yang, F., Mooney, S. M., Getzenberg, R. H., Orban, J., and Kulkarni, P. (2011) The cancer/testis antigen prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4) is a highly intrinsically disordered protein. J. Biol. Chem. 286, 13985-13994). Phosphorylation of PAGE4 at Thr-51 is critical for potentiating c-Jun transactivation, an important factor in controlling cell growth, apoptosis, and stress response. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that the PAGE4 polypeptide chain has local and long-range conformational preferences that are perturbed by site-specific phosphorylation at Thr-51. The population of transient turn-like structures increases upon phosphorylation in an ∼20-residue acidic region centered on Thr-51. This central region therefore becomes more compact and more negatively charged, with increasing intramolecular contacts to basic sequence motifs near the N and C termini. Although flexibility is decreased in the central region of phospho-PAGE4, the polypeptide chain remains highly dynamic overall. PAGE4 utilizes a transient helical structure adjacent to the central acidic region to bind c-Jun with low affinity in vitro. The binding interaction is attenuated by phosphorylation at Thr-51, most likely because of masking the effects of the more compact phosphorylated state. Therefore, phosphorylation of PAGE4 leads to conformational shifts in the dynamic ensemble, with large functional consequences. The changes in the structural ensemble induced by posttranslational modifications are similar conceptually to the conformational switching events seen in some marginally stable ("metamorphic") folded proteins in response to mutation or environmental triggers.},

abstract = {Multisite phosphorylation is ubiquitous in cellular signaling and is thought to provide signaling proteins with additional regulatory mechanisms. Indeed, mathematical models have revealed a large number of mechanisms by which multisite phosphorylation can produce switchlike responses. The T cell antigen receptor (TCR) is a multisubunit receptor on the surface of T cells that is a prototypical multisite substrate as it contains 20 sites that are distributed on 10 conserved immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). The TCR ??-chain is a homodimer subunit that contains six ITAMs (12 sites) and exhibits a number of properties that are predicted to be sufficient for a switchlike response. We have used cellular reconstitution to systematically study multisite phosphorylation of the TCR ??-chain. We find that multisite phosphorylation proceeds by a nonsequential random mechanism, and find no evidence that multiple ITAMs modulate a switchlike response but do find that they alter receptor potency and maximum phosphorylation. Modulation of receptor potency can be explained by a reduction in molecular entropy of the disordered ??-chain upon phosphorylation. We further find that the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 increases receptor potency but does not modulate the switchlike response. In contrast to other multisite proteins, where phosphorylations act in strong concert to modulate protein function, we suggest that the multiple ITAMs on the TCR function mainly to amplify subsequent signaling.},

We used molecular dynamics simulations to study the influence of different compositions of lipid bilayers on the membrane association of the CD3e cytoplasmic tails of the T-cell receptors. Our results show that binding of CD3e to membranes is modulated by both the presence of negatively charged lipids and the lipid order of the membrane. Free-energy calculations reveal that the protein-membrane interaction is favored by the presence of nearby basic residues and the ITAM tyrosines. Phosphorylation minimizes membrane association, rendering the ITAM motif more accessible to binding partners. In systems mimicking biological membranes, the CD3e chain localization is modulated by different facilitator lipids (e.g., gangliosides or phosphoinositols), revealing a plausible regulatory effect on activation through the regulation of lipid composition in cell membranes.},

abstract = {Molecular functions of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), such as molecular recognition and cellular signaling, are ascribed to dynamic changes in the conformational space in response to binding of target molecules. Sortase, a transpeptitase in Gram-positive bacteria, has an IDR in a loop which undergoes a disordered-to-ordered transition (called "disordered loop"), accompanying a tilt of another loop ("dynamic loop"), upon binding of a signal peptide and a calcium ion. In this study, all-atom conformational ensembles of sortase were calculated for the four different binding states (with/without the peptide and with/without a calcium ion) by the multiscale enhanced sampling (MSES) simulation to examine how the binding of the peptide and/or calcium influences the conformational ensemble. The MSES is a multiscale and multicopy simulation method that allows an enhanced sampling of the all-atom model of large proteins including explicit solvent. A 100 ns MSES simulation of the ligand-free sortase using 20 replicas (in total 2 $\mu$s) demonstrated large flexibility in both the disordered and dynamic loops; however, their distributions were not random but had a clear preference which populates the N-terminal part of the disordered loop near the bound form. The MSES simulations of the three binding states clarified the allosteric mechanism of sortase: the N- and C-terminal parts of the disordered loop undergo a disorder-to-order transition independently of each other upon binding of the peptide and a calcium ion, respectively; however, upon binding of both ligands, the two parts work cooperatively to stabilize the bound peptide.},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins play important roles in cell signalling, transcription, translation and cell cycle regulation. Although they lack stable tertiary structure, many intrinsically disordered proteins undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding to partners. Similarly, several folded proteins use regulated order-to-disorder transitions to mediate biological function. In principle, the function of intrinsically disordered proteins may be controlled by post-translational modifications that lead to structural changes such as folding, although this has not been observed. Here we show that multisite phosphorylation induces folding of the intrinsically disordered 4E-BP2, the major neural isoform of the family of three mammalian proteins that bind eIF4E and suppress cap-dependent translation initiation. In its non-phosphorylated state, 4E-BP2 interacts tightly with eIF4E using both a canonical YXXXXL$\Phi$ motif (starting at Y54) that undergoes a disorder-to-helix transition upon binding and a dynamic secondary binding site. We demonstrate that phosphorylation at T37 and T46 induces folding of residues P18-R62 of 4E-BP2 into a four-stranded $\beta$-domain that sequesters the helical YXXXXL$\Phi$ motif into a partly buried $\beta$-strand, blocking its accessibility to eIF4E. The folded state of pT37pT46 4E-BP2 is weakly stable, decreasing affinity by 100-fold and leading to an order-to-disorder transition upon binding to eIF4E, whereas fully phosphorylated 4E-BP2 is more stable, decreasing affinity by a factor of approximately 4,000. These results highlight stabilization of a phosphorylation-induced fold as the essential mechanism for phospho-regulation of the 4E-BP:eIF4E interaction and exemplify a new mode of biological regulation mediated by intrinsically disordered proteins.},

abstract = {The CD3$\epsilon$ and $\zeta$ cytoplasmic domains of the T cell receptor bind to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM), and a previous nuclear magnetic resonance structure showed that both tyrosines of the CD3$\epsilon$ immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif partition into the bilayer. Electrostatic interactions between acidic phospholipids and clusters of basic CD3$\epsilon$ residues were previously shown to be essential for CD3$\epsilon$ and $\zeta$ membrane binding. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is the most abundant negatively charged lipid on the inner leaflet of the PM and makes a major contribution to membrane binding by the CD3$\epsilon$ cytoplasmic domain. Here, we show that TCR triggering by peptide--MHC complexes induces dissociation of the CD3$\epsilon$ cytoplasmic domain from the plasma membrane. Release of the CD3$\epsilon$ cytoplasmic domain from the membrane is accompanied by a substantial focal reduction in negative charge and available PS in TCR microclusters. These changes in the lipid composition of TCR microclusters even occur when TCR signaling is blocked with a Src kinase inhibitor. Local changes in the lipid composition of TCR microclusters thus render the CD3$\epsilon$ cytoplasmic domain accessible during early stages of T cell activation.},

abstract = {Multisite protein phosphorylation is a common regulatory mechanism in cell signaling, and dramatically increases the possibilities for protein–protein interactions, conformational regulation, and phosphorylation pathways. However, there is at present no comprehensive picture of how these factors shape the response of a protein's phosphorylation state to changes in kinase and phosphatase activities. Here we provide a mathematical theory for the regulation of multisite protein phosphorylation based on the mechanistic description of elementary binding and catalytic steps. Explicit solutions for the steady-state response curves and characteristic (de)phosphorylation times have been obtained in special cases. The order of phosphate processing and the characteristics of protein–protein interactions turn out to be of overriding importance for both sensitivity and speed of response. Random phosphate processing gives rise to shallow response curves, favoring intermediate phosphorylation states of the target, and rapid kinetics. Sequential processing is characterized by steeper response curves and slower kinetics. We show systematically how qualitative differences in target phosphorylation − including graded, switch-like and bistable responses − are determined by the relative concentrations of enzyme and target as well as the enzyme–target affinities. In addition to collective effects of several phosphorylation sites, our analysis predicts that distinct phosphorylation patterns can be finely tuned by a single kinase. Taken together, this study suggests a versatile regulation of protein activation by the combined effect of structural, kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of multisite phosphorylation.},

abstract = {Ionic protein-lipid interactions are critical for the structure and function of membrane receptors, ion channels, integrins and many other proteins. However, the regulatory mechanism of these interactions is largely unknown. Here we show that Ca(2+) can bind directly to anionic phospholipids and thus modulate membrane protein function. The activation of T-cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex (TCR), a key membrane receptor for adaptive immunity, is regulated by ionic interactions between positively charged CD3epsilon/zeta cytoplasmic domains (CD3(CD)) and negatively charged phospholipids in the plasma membrane. Crucial tyrosines are buried in the membrane and are largely protected from phosphorylation in resting T cells. It is not clear how CD3(CD) dissociates from the membrane in antigen-stimulated T cells. The antigen engagement of even a single TCR triggers a Ca(2+) influx and TCR-proximal Ca(2+) concentration is higher than the average cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration. Our biochemical, live-cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer and NMR experiments showed that an increase in Ca(2+) concentration induced the dissociation of CD3(CD) from the membrane and the solvent exposure of tyrosine residues. As a consequence, CD3 tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly enhanced by Ca(2+) influx. Moreover, when compared with wild-type cells, Ca(2+) channel-deficient T cells had substantially lower levels of CD3 phosphorylation after stimulation. The effect of Ca(2+) on facilitating CD3 phosphorylation is primarily due to the charge of this ion, as demonstrated by the fact that replacing Ca(2+) with the non-physiological ion Sr(2+) resulted in the same feedback effect. Finally, (31)P NMR spectroscopy showed that Ca(2+) bound to the phosphate group in anionic phospholipids at physiological concentrations, thus neutralizing the negative charge of phospholipids. Rather than initiating CD3 phosphorylation, this regulatory pathway of Ca(2+) has a positive feedback effect on amplifying and sustaining CD3 phosphorylation and should enhance T-cell sensitivity to foreign antigens. Our study thus provides a new regulatory mechanism of Ca(2+) to T-cell activation involving direct lipid manipulation.},

We report direct single molecule measurements of TCR triggering by agonist pMHC in hybrid junctions between live primary T cells and supported lipid membranes. Every pMHC:TCR complex over the entire cell is tracked while simultaneously monitoring the local membrane recruitment of ZAP70, as a readout of TCR triggering. Mean dwell times for pMHC:TCR molecular binding of 5 and 54 s were measured for two different pMHC:TCR systems. Single molecule measurements of the pMHC:TCR:ZAP70 complex indicate that TCR triggering is stoichiometric with agonist pMHC in a 1:1 ratio.

The tether confines the diffusive motion of the receptor thus influencing the rate at which it captures ligands that are free in solution. We compute steady-state collision rates between ligand and receptor for this "tethered-capture" mechanism using a combination of analytic and numerical techniques. In doing so, we uncover a dimensionless control parameter, the "opacity," that determines under what conditions and to what extent a tether regulates the ligand-receptor collision rate. We compute the opacity for a number of different tethering scenarios that appear in biology and use these results to predict the affect of changing the length and flexibility of the tether on the rate at which ligands are captured from solution.},

abstract = {Kinesin stepping is thought to involve both concerted conformational changes and diffusive movement, but the relative roles played by these two processes are not clear. The neck linker docking model is widely accepted in the field, but the remainder of the step--diffusion of the tethered head to the next binding site--is often assumed to occur rapidly with little mechanical resistance. Here, we investigate the effect of tethering by the neck linker on the diffusive movement of the kinesin head, and focus on the predicted behavior of motors with naturally or artificially extended neck linker domains. The kinesin chemomechanical cycle was modeled using a discrete-state Markov chain to describe chemical transitions. Brownian dynamics were used to model the tethered diffusion of the free head, incorporating resistive forces from the neck linker and a position-dependent microtubule binding rate. The Brownian dynamics and chemomechanical cycle were coupled to model processive runs consisting of many 8 nm steps. Three mechanical models of the neck linker were investigated: Constant Stiffness (a simple spring), Increasing Stiffness (analogous to a Worm-Like Chain), and Reflecting (negligible stiffness up to a limiting contour length). Motor velocities and run lengths from simulated paths were compared to experimental results from Kinesin-1 and a mutant containing an extended neck linker domain. When tethered by an increasingly stiff spring, the head is predicted to spend an unrealistically short amount of time within the binding zone, and extending the neck is predicted to increase both the velocity and processivity, contrary to experiments. These results suggest that the Worm-Like Chain is not an adequate model for the flexible neck linker domain. The model can be reconciled with experimental data if the neck linker is either much more compliant or much stiffer than generally assumed, or if weak kinesin-microtubule interactions stabilize the diffusing head near its binding site.},

abstract = {Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are fundamental units of protein function and regulation. Despite their inability to form a unique stable tertiary structure in isolation, many IDRs adopt a defined conformation upon binding and achieve their function through their interactions with other biomolecules. However, this requirement for IDR functionality seems to be at odds with the high entropic cost they must incur upon binding an interaction partner. How is this seeming paradox resolved? While increasing the enthalpy of binding is one approach to compensate for this entropic cost, growing evidence suggests that inherent features of IDRs, for instance repeating linear motifs, minimise the entropic cost of binding. Moreover, this control of entropic cost can be carefully modulated by a range of regulatory mechanisms, such as alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, which enable allosteric communication and rheostat-like tuning of IDR function. In that sense, the high entropic cost of IDR binding can be advantageous by providing tunability to protein function. In addition to biological regulatory mechanisms, modulation of entropy can also be controlled by environmental factors, such as changes in temperature, redox-potential and pH. These principles are extensively exploited by a number of organisms, including pathogens. They can also be utilised in bioengineering, synthetic biology and in pharmaceutical applications such as increasing bioavailability of protein therapeutics. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The T-cell receptor (TCR) consists of a TCR$\alpha$$\beta$ heterodimer, a TCR$\zeta$ homodimer, and CD3$\gamma$$\epsilon$ and CD3$\delta$$\epsilon$ heterodimers. The precise mechanism of T-cell triggering following TCR ligand engagement remains elusive. Previous studies reported that the cytoplasmic tail of CD3$\epsilon$ binds to the plasma membrane through a basic residue-rich stretch (BRS) and proposed that dissociation from the membrane is required for phosphorylation thereof. In this report we show that BRS motifs within the cytoplasmic tail of TCR$\zeta$ mediate association with the plasma membrane and that TCR engagement results in TCR$\zeta$ dissociation from the membrane. This dissociation requires phosphorylation of the TCR$\zeta$ immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs by lymphocyte cell-specificprotein tyrosine kinase (Lck) but not $\zeta$-chain-associated protein kinase 70 binding. Mutations of the TCR$\zeta$ BRS motifs that disrupt this membrane association attenuate proximal and distal responses induced by TCR engagement. These mutations appear to alter the localization of TCR$\zeta$ with respect to Lck as well as the mobility of the TCR complex. This study reveals that tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCR$\zeta$ cytoplasmic domain regulates its association with the plasma membrane and highlights the functional importance of TCR$\zeta$ BRS motifs.},
